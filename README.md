# problemsolving
Problem Solving is based on my solution for solving probelms in a company, government, country and world. The idea is:
1. Users can submit Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats and probelms: we call "problem" to all of them
2. Users can vote for problems, so the most important probelms can be found easily
3. Users can submit solutions, each colution can solve one ore more problems
4. Users can vote for solutions, so the most important solutions can be found easily

I belieave me and every body else work in this open source solution will shape part of the good fouture of this world.
